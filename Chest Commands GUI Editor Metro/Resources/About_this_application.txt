I'm Quach Tri Dat, a high school student who are really interested in programming, especially C#. 
C# is powerful and really easy to use, although currently it is mostly available only for Windows.

The idea of this editor was initially by me. I was working as backend staff of a Minecraft server, and I found it time-consuming to sit and write many lines of YAML code for Chest Commands GUI.
I want to help the other staff members save the time, and also to strengthen my C# skills.
Instead of just writing lines of code, now with this application, we can interactively and easily create a menu, then the code will be automatically generated.
My backend was not so good, but it works well, and I feel glad about it.

This application was first written from the scratch without any fancy appearance, but thanks to MetroFramework - a free, open-source framework that provides good-looking theme for WinForms, developed by Jens Thiel.
He hosted his work at https://thielj.github.io/MetroFramework/.

Also, YamlDotNet, written by Antoine Aubry, is such a great library for YAML. I really appreciate his work.
YamlDotNet can be found at his homepage: http://aaubry.net/pages/yamldotnet.html.

And last, thanks a bunch for using this application!
